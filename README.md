# Clojure-webmvc
The Model-View-Controller or MVC pattern is used extensively in web applications to separate the different concerns of each web application layer in accordance with SOLID design principles. However the MVC pattern alone is not sufficient to manage the application complexity as the functionality of the web application grows. As the functionality grows, the need for cleanly structured components in web application also grows in importance. Most real web applications use conventions to structure the code. These conventions for structuring the code can take the form of package structure in java, file names in ruby/rails. 

Frameworks like ruby-on-rails, spring-mvc, spring-roo impose a code structure convention unique to each framework. Clojure-webmvc supports imposing a convention for an MVC based web application.
